![AIPuzzleSolverUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ed3e853-bd38-4c3b-81c5-b9de890040b1)

A JavaFX-based project featuring four small games alongside AI solvers (BFS, DFS, A*) for solving in-game challenges. This is project implemented in Java using NetBeans. 

:books:## Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: A GUI built with JavaFX to interact with the puzzle problem and see the solution steps.
- **Multiple Search Algorithms**: Choose between BFS, DFS, and A* search to solve the puzzle.
- **Statistics Display**: Displays the statistics of the search process such as number of moves, time taken, and search type.
- **Reset & Solve**: Options to reset the puzzle and solve it step-by-step or automatically.
